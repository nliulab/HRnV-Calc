   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sepsis remains the largest preventable source of neonatal mortality in the world. Heart rate variability (HRV) analysis and noninvasive cardiac output have been shown to be useful adjuncts to sepsis detection in many patient groups. METHODS: With Institutional Review Board approval, 4 septic and 6 nonseptic extremely low birth weight patients were enrolled. Data from septic and healthy patients were collected for 5 hours. Electrocardiogram waveform and traditional vital signs were collected and the RR intervals were calculated; then HRV analysis was performed in both the time and frequency domain. RESULTS: HRV measurements in time domain, heart rate, and pulse oximetry (SpO2) were significantly different in septic patients vs nonseptic controls. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that nonconventional vital signs such as HRV are more sensitive than traditionally used vital signs, such as cardiac output and mean arterial pressure, in the confirmation of sepsis in extremely low birth weight neonates. HRV may allow for earlier identification of septic physiology. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Heart rate, measured as beat-to-beat intervals, is not constant and varies in time. This property is known as heart rate variability (HRV) and it has been investigated in several diseases, including myocardial infarction (MI). The main hypothesis is that HRV embed some physiological processes that are characteristics of regulatory systems acting on cardiovascular system. It is possible to quantify such a complex behaviour starting from RR intervals properties itself with the idea that any event affecting the cardiac regulatory system significantly will disrupt and change HRV. In this article, we first review different methodologies previously published to calculate HRV indexes. We then searched literature for studies published on HRV and MI and we derive a metanalysis where published data allow calculation of composite outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Articles considered eligible for metanalysis were original retrospective/prospective studies investigating HRV after myocardial infarction, reporting follow up for mortality or significant cardiac complications. Random effect model was used to assessed for homogeneity and calculate composite outcome and its 95% confidence interval (CI). RESULTS: 21 studies were identified as eligible for subsequent analysis. Among these studies 5 large trials were eligible for metanalysis: "they included 3489 total post-MI patient with an overall mortality of 125/577 (21.7%) in patients with standard deviation of RR intervals (SDNN) less than 70 msec compared to 235/2912 (8.1%) in patients with SDNN > 70 msec". Metanalysis demonstrates that, after a MI, patients with SDNN below 70 msec on 24 hours ECG recording have almost 4 times more chance to die in the next 3 years. CONCLUSION: Results from metanalysis and other studies considered (but not included in the analysis) are consistent with the final finding, that a disrupted HRV dynamic (low SDNN) is associated with higher adverse outcome. In this perspective, although data are strongly positive for a direct relationship between SDNN and mortality after MI, SDNN value must be considered carefully on a single patient. The primary purpose of the metanalysis was to address whether studies conducted on HRV and MI were consistent rather than established a cut-off for SDNN. HRV is simple, non invasive and relatively not expensive to obtain.},

However, traditional algorithms indicate higher complexity for certain pathologic processes associated with random outputs than for healthy dynamics exhibiting long-range correlations. This paradox may be due to the fact that conventional algorithms fail to account for the multiple time scales inherent in healthy physiologic dynamics. We introduce a method to calculate multiscale entropy (MSE) for complex time series. We find that MSE robustly separates healthy and pathologic groups and consistently yields higher values for simulated long-range correlated noise compared to uncorrelated noise.},

   abstract = {Dynamic aspects of R-R intervals have often been analyzed by means of linear and nonlinear measures. The goal of this study was to analyze binary sequences, in which only the dynamic information is retained, by means of two different aspects of regularity. R-R interval sequences derived from 24-h electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings of 118 healthy subjects were converted to symbolic binary sequences that coded the beat-to-beat increase or decrease in the R-R interval. Shannon entropy was used to quantify the occurrence of short binary patterns (length N = 5) in binary sequences derived from 10-min intervals. The regularity of the short binary patterns was analyzed on the basis of approximate entropy (ApEn). ApEn had a linear dependence on mean R-R interval length, with increasing irregularity occurring at longer R-R interval length. Shannon entropy of the same sequences showed that the increase in irregularity is accompanied by a decrease in occurrence of some patterns. Taken together, these data indicate that irregular binary patterns are more probable when the mean R-R interval increases. The use of surrogate data confirmed a nonlinear component in the binary sequence. Analysis of two consecutive 24-h ECG recordings for each subject demonstrated good intraindividual reproducibility of the results. In conclusion, quantification of binary sequences derived from ECG recordings reveals properties that cannot be found using the full information of R-R interval sequences.},

   abstract = {Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a serious heart arrhythmia leading to a significant increase of the risk for occurrence of ischemic stroke. Clinically, the AF episode is recognized in an electrocardiogram. However, detection of asymptomatic AF, which requires a long-term monitoring, is more efficient when based on irregularity of beat-to-beat intervals estimated by the heart rate (HR) features. Automated classification of heartbeats into AF and non-AF by means of the Lagrangian Support Vector Machine has been proposed. The classifier input vector consisted of sixteen features, including four coefficients very sensitive to beat-to-beat heart changes, taken from the fetal heart rate analysis in perinatal medicine. Effectiveness of the proposed classifier has been verified on the MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database. Designing of the LSVM classifier using very large number of feature vectors requires extreme computational efforts. Therefore, an original approach has been proposed to determine a training set of the smallest possible size that still would guarantee a high quality of AF detection. It enables to obtain satisfactory results using only 1.39% of all heartbeats as the training data. Post-processing stage based on aggregation of classified heartbeats into AF episodes has been applied to provide more reliable information on patient risk. Results obtained during the testing phase showed the sensitivity of 98.94%, positive predictive value of 98.39%, and classification accuracy of 98.86%.},

We assess if type 1 diabetes mellitus promote modification in autonomic nervous system using the main two types of algorithms to estimate a Fractal Dimension: Higuchi and Katz. Methods: 46 adults were divided into two equal groups. The autonomic evaluation consisted of recording heart rate variability (HRV) for 30 minutes in supine position in absence of any other stimuli. Fractal dimensions ought then able to determine which series of interbeat intervals are derived from diabetics’ or not. We then equated results to observe which assessment gave the greatest significance by One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA1), Kruskal-Wallis technique and Cohen’s d effect sizes. Results: Katz’s fractal dimension is the most robust algorithm when assisted by a cubic spline interpolation (6 Hz) to increase the number of samples in the dataset. This was categorical after two tests for normality; then, ANOVA1, Kruskal-Wallis and Cohen’s d effect sizes (p≈0.01 and Cohen’s d=0.814143 –medium effect size). Conclusion: Diabetes significantly reduced the chaotic response as measured by Katz’s fractal dimension. Katz’s fractal dimension is a viable statistical marker for subjects with type 1 diabetes mellitus.},

This study combined data (N = 657) of five different cancers (colorectal, pancreas, prostate, lung and ovarian) concerning patients' Heart Rate Variability (HRV), a vagal nerve activity index. These data were compared to HRV levels of a healthy sample in another study. In addition, we examined the moderating effects of age, gender and cancer stage on HRV. The mean HRV of the cancer patients sample was significantly lower (HRV = 22 ms) compared to the healthy sample (HRV = 50 ms) (p < 0.000001). While age and gender did not significantly affect HRV, cancer patients with advanced stages had significantly lower HRV than those with early stages (p = 0.011). A possible bi-directional relation between cancer and vagal nerve activity is discussed. These findings are of importance for prognostication since they provide researchers and clinicians with expected values of vagal nerve activity in cancer patients.

Although the clinical application of HRV is mainly associated with the prediction of sudden cardiac death and assessing cardiovascular and metabolic illness progression, recent observations have suggested its applicability to physical exercise training. HRV is becoming one of the most useful tools for tracking the time course of training adaptation/maladaptation of athletes and in setting the optimal training loads leading to improved performances. However, little is known regarding the role of HRV and the internal effects of physical exercise on an athlete, which may be useful in designing fitness programs ensuring sufficient training load that may correspond with the specific ability of the athlete. In this review, we offer a comprehensive assessment of investigations concerning the interrelation between HRV and ANS, and examine how the application of HRV to physical exercise may play a role in sports physiology.},

   abstract = {Background and Objective: Heart rate variability parameters are studied by the research community as potential valuable indices for seizure detection and anticipation. This paper investigates heart activity abnormalities during focal epileptic seizures in childhood. Methods: Seizures affect both the sympathetic and parasympathetic system which is expressed as abnormal patterns of heart rate variability (HRV) parameters. In the present study, a clinical dataset containing 42 focal seizures in long-term electrocardiographic (ECG) recordings from drug-resistant pediatric epileptic patients (with age 8.2 +/- 4.3 years) was analyzed. Results: Results indicate that the time domain HRV parameters (heart rate, SDNN, standard deviation of heart rate, upper envelope) and spectral HRV parameters (LF/HF, normalized HF, normalized LF, total power) are significantly affected during ictal periods. The HRV features were ranked in terms of their relevance and efficacy to discriminate non-ictal/ictal periods and the top-ranked features were selected using the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance algorithm for further analysis. Then, a personalized anticipation algorithm based on multiple regression was introduced providing an "epileptic index" of imminent seizures. The performance of the system resulted in anticipation accuracy of 77.1% and an anticipation time of 21.8 s. Conclusions: The results of this analysis could permit the anticipation of focal seizures only using electrocardiographic signals and the implementation of seizure anticipation strategies for a range of real-life clinical applications.

   abstract = {The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a well studied signal from which many clinically relevant parameters can be derived, such as heart rate. A key component in the estimation of these parameters is the accurate detection of the R peak in the QRS complex. While corruption of the ECG by movement artefact or sensor failure can result in poor delineation of the R peak, use of synchronously measured signals could allow for resolution of the R peak even scenarios with poor quality ECG recordings. Robust estimation of R peak locations from multimodal signals facilitates real time monitoring and is likely to reduce false alarms due to inaccurate derived parameters.We propose a method which fuses R peaks detected on the ECG using an energy detector with those detected on the arterial blood pressure (ABP) waveform using the length transform. A signal quality index (SQI) for the two signals is then derived. The ECG SQI is based upon the agreement between two distinct peak detectors. The ABP SQI estimates the blood pressure at various phases in the cardiac cycle and only accepts the signal as good quality if the values are physiologically plausible. Detections from these two signals were merged by selecting the R peak detections from the signal with a higher SQI. The approach presented in this paper was evaluated on datasets provided for the Physionet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2014. The algorithm achieved a sensitivity of 95.1% and positive predictive value of 89.3% on an external evaluation set, and achieved a score of 91.5%.The method here demonstrated excellent performance across a variety of signal morphologies collected during clinical practice. Fusion of R peaks from other signals has the potential to provide informed estimates of the R peak location in situations where the ECG is noisy or completely absent.

We calculated the fractal exponent and sample entropy of the R-R time series for nine participants who walked on four paths with various complexities. The findings showed a strong coupling among the alterations of fractal dimension (an indicator of complexity) of HRV and the walking paths. Besides, the result of the analysis of sample entropy also verified the obtained results from the fractal analysis.

   abstract = {Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal has been commonly used to analyze the complexity of heart rate variability (HRV). For this, various entropy methods have been considerably of interest. The multiscale entropy (MSE) method, which makes use of the sample entropy (SampEn) calculation of coarse-grained time series, has attracted attention for analysis of HRV. However, the SampEn computation may fail to be defined when the length of a time series is not enough long. Recently, distribution entropy (DistEn) with improved stability for a short-term time series has been proposed. Here, we propose a novel multiscale DistEn (MDE) for analysis of the complexity of short-term HRV by utilizing a moving-averaging multiscale process and the DistEn computation of each moving-averaged time series. Thus, it provides an improved stability of entropy evaluation for short-term HRV extracted from ECG. To verify the performance of MDE, we employ the analysis of synthetic signals and confirm the superiority of MDE over MSE. Then, we evaluate the complexity of short-term HRV extracted from ECG signals of congestive heart failure (CHF) patients and healthy subjects. The experimental results exhibit that MDE is capable of quantifying the decreased complexity of HRV with aging and CHF disease with short-term HRV time series.},

   abstract = {This paper proposed a new entropy measure, Fuzzy Measure Entropy (FuzzyMEn), for the analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) signals. FuzzyMEn was calculated based on the fuzzy set theory and improved the poor statistical stability in the approximate entropy (ApEn) and sample entropy (SampEn). The simulation results also demonstrated that the FuzzyMEn had better algorithm discrimination ability when compared with the recently published fuzzy entropy (FuzzyEn), The validity of FuzzyMEn was tested for clinical HRV analysis on 120 subjects (60 heart failure and 60 healthy control subjects). It is concluded that FuzzyMEn could be considered as a valid and reliable method for a clinical HRV application.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chest pain is one of the most common complaints among patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Causes of chest pain can be benign or life threatening, making accurate risk stratification a critical issue in the ED. In addition to the use of established clinical scores, prior studies have attempted to create predictive models with heart rate variability (HRV). In this study, we proposed heart rate n-variability (HRnV), an alternative representation of beat-to-beat variation in electrocardiogram (ECG), and investigated its association with major adverse cardiac events (MACE) in ED patients with chest pain. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of data collected from the ED of a tertiary hospital in Singapore between September 2010 and July 2015. Patients > 20 years old who presented to the ED with chief complaint of chest pain were conveniently recruited. Five to six-minute single-lead ECGs, demographics, medical history, troponin, and other required variables were collected. We developed the HRnV-Calc software to calculate HRnV parameters. The primary outcome was 30-day MACE, which included all-cause death, acute myocardial infarction, and revascularization. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate the association between individual risk factors and the outcome. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to compare the HRnV model (based on leave-one-out cross-validation) against other clinical scores in predicting 30-day MACE. RESULTS: A total of 795 patients were included in the analysis, of which 247 (31%) had MACE within 30 days. The MACE group was older, with a higher proportion being male patients. Twenty-one conventional HRV and 115 HRnV parameters were calculated. In univariable analysis, eleven HRV and 48 HRnV parameters were significantly associated with 30-day MACE. The multivariable stepwise logistic regression identified 16 predictors that were strongly associated with MACE outcome; these predictors consisted of one HRV, seven HRnV parameters, troponin, ST segment changes, and several other factors. The HRnV model outperformed several clinical scores in the ROC analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The novel HRnV representation demonstrated its value of augmenting HRV and traditional risk factors in designing a robust risk stratification tool for patients with chest pain in the ED.},

   abstract = {Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt recognition and treatment. Recently, heart rate variability (HRV), a measure of the cardiac autonomic regulation derived from short electrocardiogram tracings, has been found to correlate with sepsis mortality. This paper presents using novel heart rate n-variability (HRnV) measures for sepsis mortality risk prediction and comparing against current mortality prediction scores. This study was a retrospective cohort study on patients presenting to the emergency department of a tertiary hospital in Singapore between September 2014 to April 2017. Patients were included if they were above 21 years old and were suspected of having sepsis by their attending physician. The primary outcome was 30-day in-hospital mortality. Stepwise multivariable logistic regression model was built to predict the outcome, and the results based on 10-fold cross-validation were presented using receiver operating curve analysis. The final predictive model comprised 21 variables, including four vital signs, two HRV parameters, and 15 HRnV parameters. The area under the curve of the model was 0.77 (95% confidence interval 0.70–0.84), outperforming several established clinical scores. The HRnV measures may have the potential to allow for a rapid, objective, and accurate means of patient risk stratification for sepsis severity and mortality. Our exploration of the use of wealthy inherent information obtained from novel HRnV measures could also create a new perspective for data scientists to develop innovative approaches for ECG analysis and risk monitoring.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Heart rate variability (HRV) has increasingly been linked to medical phenomena and several HRV metrics have been found to be good indicators of patient health. This has enabled generalised treatment plans to be developed in order to respond to subtle personal differences that are reflected in HRV metrics. There are several established HRV analysis platforms and methods available within the literature; some of which provide command line operation across databases but do not offer extensive graphical user interface (GUI) and editing functionality, while others offer extensive ECG editing but are not feasible over large datasets without considerable manual effort. The aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive open-source package, in a well known and multi-platform language, that offers considerable graphical signal editing features, flexibility within the algorithms used for R-peak detection and HRV quantification, and includes graphical functionality for batch processing. Thereby, providing a platform suited to either physician or researcher. METHODS: RR-APET's software was developed in the Python language and is modular in format, providing a range of different modules for established R-peak detection algorithms, as well as an embedded template for alternate algorithms. These modules also include several easily adjustable features, allowing the user to optimise any of the algorithms for different ECG signals or databases. Additionally, the software's user-friendly GUI platform can be operated by both researchers or medical professionals to accomplish different tasks, such as: the in-depth visual analysis of a single ECG, or the analysis multiple signals in a single iteration using batch processing. RR-APET also supports several popular data formats, including text, HDF5, Matlab, and Waveform Database (WFDB) files. RESULTS: The RR-APET platform presents multiple metrics that quantify the heart rate variability features of an R-to-R interval series, including time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear metrics. When known R-peak annotations are available, positive predictability, sensitivity, detection error rate, and accuracy measures are also provided to assess the validity of the implemented R-peak detection algorithm. RR-APET scored an overall usability rating of 4.16 out of a possible 5, when released on a trial basis for user evaluation. CONCLUSIONS: With its unique ability to both create and operate on large databases, this software provides a strong platform from which to conduct further research in the field of HRV analytics and its correlation to patient healthcare outcomes. This software is available free of charge at https://gitlab.com/MegMcC/rr-apet-hrv-analysis-software and can be operated as an executable file within Windows, Mac and Linux systems.},

The proposed classifier separates lower risk patients from higher risk ones, using standard long-term heart rate variability (HRV) measures. Patients are labeled as lower or higher risk according to the New York Heart Association classification (NYHA). A retrospective analysis on two public Holter databases was performed, analyzing the data of 12 patients suffering from mild CHF (NYHA I and II), labeled as lower risk, and 32 suffering from severe CHF (NYHA III and IV), labeled as higher risk. Only patients with a fraction of total heartbeats intervals (RR) classified as normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (NN/RR) higher than 80% were selected as eligible in order to have a satisfactory signal quality. Classification and regression tree (CART) was employed to develop the classifiers. A total of 30 higher risk and 11 lower risk patients were included in the analysis. The proposed classification trees achieved a sensitivity and a specificity rate of 93.3% and 63.6%, respectively, in identifying higher risk patients. Finally, the rules obtained by CART are comprehensible and consistent with the consensus showed by previous studies that depressed HRV is a useful tool for risk assessment in patients suffering from CHF.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Optical sensors on wearable devices can detect irregular pulses. The ability of a smartwatch application (app) to identify atrial fibrillation during typical use is unknown. METHODS: Participants without atrial fibrillation (as reported by the participants themselves) used a smartphone (Apple iPhone) app to consent to monitoring. If a smartwatch-based irregular pulse notification algorithm identified possible atrial fibrillation, a telemedicine visit was initiated and an electrocardiography (ECG) patch was mailed to the participant, to be worn for up to 7 days. Surveys were administered 90 days after notification of the irregular pulse and at the end of the study. The main objectives were to estimate the proportion of notified participants with atrial fibrillation shown on an ECG patch and the positive predictive value of irregular pulse intervals with a targeted confidence interval width of 0.10. RESULTS: We recruited 419,297 participants over 8 months. Over a median of 117 days of monitoring, 2161 participants (0.52%) received notifications of irregular pulse. Among the 450 participants who returned ECG patches containing data that could be analyzed - which had been applied, on average, 13 days after notification - atrial fibrillation was present in 34% (97.5% confidence interval [CI], 29 to 39) overall and in 35% (97.5% CI, 27 to 43) of participants 65 years of age or older. Among participants who were notified of an irregular pulse, the positive predictive value was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.76 to 0.92) for observing atrial fibrillation on the ECG simultaneously with a subsequent irregular pulse notification and 0.71 (97.5% CI, 0.69 to 0.74) for observing atrial fibrillation on the ECG simultaneously with a subsequent irregular tachogram. Of 1376 notified participants who returned a 90-day survey, 57% contacted health care providers outside the study. There were no reports of serious app-related adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: The probability of receiving an irregular pulse notification was low. Among participants who received notification of an irregular pulse, 34% had atrial fibrillation on subsequent ECG patch readings and 84% of notifications were concordant with atrial fibrillation. This siteless (no on-site visits were required for the participants), pragmatic study design provides a foundation for large-scale pragmatic studies in which outcomes or adherence can be reliably assessed with user-owned devices.

   abstract = {Heart rate variability (HRV) is a reliable reflection of the many physiological factors modulating the normal rhythm of the heart. In fact, they provide a powerful means of observing the interplay between the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It shows that the structure generating the signal is not only simply linear, but also involves nonlinear contributions. Heart rate (HR) is a nonstationary signal; its variation may contain indicators of current disease, or warnings about impending cardiac diseases. The indicators may be present at all times or may occur at random-during certain intervals of the day. It is strenuous and time consuming to study and pinpoint abnormalities in voluminous data collected over several hours. Hence, HR variation analysis (instantaneous HR against time axis) has become a popular noninvasive tool for assessing the activities of the autonomic nervous system. Computer based analytical tools for in-depth study of data over daylong intervals can be very useful in diagnostics. Therefore, the HRV signal parameters, extracted and analyzed using computers, are highly useful in diagnostics. In this paper, we have discussed the various applications of HRV and different linear, frequency domain, wavelet domain, nonlinear techniques used for the analysis of the HRV.},

   abstract = {A common cause of death in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on dialysis is sudden cardiac death (SCD). Compared to the general population, the percentage of cardiovascular deaths that are attributed to SCD is higher in patients treated by dialysis. While coronary artery disease (CAD) is the predominant cause of SCD in dialysis patients, reduced heart rate variability (HRV) may play a role in the higher risk of SCD among other risk factors. HRV refers to beat-to-beat alterations in heart rate as measured by periodic variation in the R-R interval. HRV provides a non-invasive method for investigating autonomic input into the heart. It quantifies the amount by which the R-R interval or heart rate changes from one cardiac cycle to the next. The autonomic nervous system transmits impulses from the central nervous system to peripheral organs and is responsible for controlling the heart rate, blood pressure and respiratory activity. In normal individuals, without cardiac disease, the heart rate has a high degree of beat-to-beat variability. HRV fluctuates with respiration: it increases with inspiration and decreases with expiration and is primarily mediated by parasympathetic activity. HRV has been used to evaluate and quantify the cardiac risk associated with a variety of conditions including cardiac disorders, stroke, multiple sclerosis and diabetes. In this narrative review, we will examine the association between HRV and SCD. This report explains the measurement of HRV and the consequences of reduced HRV in the general population and dialysis patients. Lastly, this review will outline the possible use of HRV as a clinical predictor for SCD in the dialysis population. The current understanding of SCD based on HRV findings among the ESRD population support the use of more aggressive treatment of CAD; greater use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-i)/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and beta-blockers and more frequent and/or nocturnal haemodialysis to improve the survival of a patient with kidney failure.},

   abstract = {Following the publication of the Task Force document on heart rate variability (HRV) in 1996, a number of articles have been published to describe new HRV methodologies and their application in different physiological and clinical studies. This document presents a critical review of the new methods. A particular attention has been paid to methodologies that have not been reported in the 1996 standardization document but have been more recently tested in sufficiently sized populations. The following methods were considered: Long-range correlation and fractal analysis; Short-term complexity; Entropy and regularity; and Nonlinear dynamical systems and chaotic behaviour. For each of these methods, technical aspects, clinical achievements, and suggestions for clinical application were reviewed. While the novel approaches have contributed in the technical understanding of the signal character of HRV, their success in developing new clinical tools, such as those for the identification of high-risk patients, has been rather limited. Available results obtained in selected populations of patients by specialized laboratories are nevertheless of interest but new prospective studies are needed. The investigation of new parameters, descriptive of the complex regulation mechanisms of heart rate, has to be encouraged because not all information in the HRV signal is captured by traditional methods. The new technologies thus could provide after proper validation, additional physiological, and clinical meaning. Multidisciplinary dialogue and specialized courses in the combination of clinical cardiology and complex signal processing methods seem warranted for further advances in studies of cardiac oscillations and in the understanding normal and abnormal cardiac control processes.},

   abstract = {Healthy biological systems exhibit complex patterns of variability that can be described by mathematical chaos. Heart rate variability (HRV) consists of changes in the time intervals between consecutive heartbeats called interbeat intervals (IBIs). A healthy heart is not a metronome. The oscillations of a healthy heart are complex and constantly changing, which allow the cardiovascular system to rapidly adjust to sudden physical and psychological challenges to homeostasis. This article briefly reviews current perspectives on the mechanisms that generate 24 h, short-term (~5 min), and ultra-short-term (<5 min) HRV, the importance of HRV, and its implications for health and performance. The authors provide an overview of widely-used HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics. Time-domain indices quantify the amount of HRV observed during monitoring periods that may range from ~2 min to 24 h. Frequency-domain values calculate the absolute or relative amount of signal energy within component bands. Non-linear measurements quantify the unpredictability and complexity of a series of IBIs. The authors survey published normative values for clinical, healthy, and optimal performance populations. They stress the importance of measurement context, including recording period length, subject age, and sex, on baseline HRV values. They caution that 24 h, short-term, and ultra-short-term normative values are not interchangeable. They encourage professionals to supplement published norms with findings from their own specialized populations. Finally, the authors provide an overview of HRV assessment strategies for clinical and optimal performance interventions.},

   abstract = {Heart rate (HR) is modulated by the combined effects of the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. Therefore, measurement of changes in HR over time (heart rate variability or HRV) provides information about autonomic functioning. HRV has been used to identify high risk people, understand the autonomic components of different disorders and to evaluate the effect of different interventions, etc. Since the signal required to measure HRV is already being collected on the electrocardiogram (ECG) channel of the polysomnogram (PSG), collecting data for research on HRV and sleep is straightforward, but applications have been limited. As reviewed here, HRV has been applied to understand autonomic changes during different sleep stages. It has also been applied to understand the effect of sleep-disordered breathing, periodic limb movements and insomnia both during sleep and during the daytime. HRV has been successfully used to screen people for possible referral to a Sleep Lab. It has also been used to monitor the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP). A novel HRV measure, cardiopulmonary coupling (CPC) has been proposed for sleep quality. Evidence also suggests that HRV collected during a PSG can be used in risk stratification models, at least for older adults. Caveats for accurate interpretation of HRV are also presented.},

   abstract = {Stress is a huge problem in today's society. Being able to measure stress, therefore, may help to address this problem. Although stress has a psychological origin, it affects several physiological processes in the human body: increased muscle tension in the neck, change in concentration of several hormones and a change in heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV). The brain innervates the heart by means of stimuli via the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS), which is divided into sympathetic and parasympathetic branches. The sympathetic activity leads to an increase in HR (e. g. during sports exercise), while parasympathetic activity induces a lower HR (e. g. during sleep). The two circuits are constantly interacting and this interaction is reflected in HRV. HRV, therefore, provides a measure to express the activity of the ANS, and may consequently provide a measure for stress. We therefore explored measures of HR and HRV with an imposed stressful situation. We recorded changes in HR and HRV in a group of 28 subjects at rest, and with a mental stressor. The results suggest that HR and HRV change with a mental task. HR and HRV recordings may have the potential, therefore, to measure stress levels and guide preventive measures to reduce stress related illnesses.},

   abstract = {Kubios HRV is an advanced and easy to use software for heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The software supports several input data formats for electrocardiogram (ECG) data and beat-to-beat RR interval data. It includes an adaptive QRS detection algorithm and tools for artifact correction, trend removal and analysis sample selection. The software computes all the commonly used time-domain and frequency-domain HRV parameters and several nonlinear parameters. There are several adjustable analysis settings through which the analysis methods can be optimized for different data. The ECG derived respiratory frequency is also computed, which is important for reliable interpretation of the analysis results. The analysis results can be saved as an ASCII text file (easy to import into MS Excel or SPSS), Matlab MAT-file, or as a PDF report. The software is easy to use through its compact graphical user interface. The software is available free of charge for Windows and Linux operating systems at http://kubios.uef.fi.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: This work aims to validate a set of data processing methods for variability metrics, which hold promise as potential indicators for autonomic function, prediction of adverse cardiovascular outcomes, psychophysiological status, and general wellness. Although the investigation of heart rate variability (HRV) has been prevalent for several decades, the methods used for preprocessing, windowing, and choosing appropriate parameters lacks consensus among academic and clinical investigators. Moreover, many of the important steps are omitted from publications, preventing reproducibility. APPROACH: To address this, we have compiled a comprehensive and open-source modular toolbox for calculating HRV metrics and other related variability indices, on both raw cardiovascular time series and RR intervals. The software, known as the PhysioNet Cardiovascular Signal Toolbox, is implemented in the MATLAB programming language, with standard (open) input and output formats, and requires no external libraries. The functioning of our software is compared with other widely used and referenced HRV toolboxes to identify important differences. MAIN RESULTS: Our findings demonstrate how modest differences in the approach to HRV analysis can lead to divergent results, a factor that might have contributed to the lack of repeatability of studies and clinical applicability of HRV metrics. SIGNIFICANCE: Existing HRV toolboxes do not include standardized preprocessing, signal quality indices (for noisy segment removal), and abnormal rhythm detection and are therefore likely to lead to significant errors in the presence of moderate to high noise or arrhythmias. We therefore describe the inclusion of validated tools to address these issues. We also make recommendations for default values and testing/reporting.},
